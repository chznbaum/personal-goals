# Personal Goals (Updated: Jan 4, 2020)

Personal goals made open source. For 2020, I want to begin logging in GitHub so I can better document and access my goals. I currently use the [Full Focus Planner | Bold](https://fullfocusstore.com/products/full-focus-planner-bold-by-megan-hyatt-miller-annual-subscription) for my written planner needs. I'm always iterating my goal setting.

## Personal Foursquare 
I wanted to create a foursquare to give more focus to any goals I set.

| Myself   | Relationships | Career  | World |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Refill my cup  | Intentionally engage  | Strengthen competency  | Pay it forward |
| Become healthy  | Plan socialization  | Build enterprise knowledge  | Limit commitments  |


## Reading Goal :books:
I *LOVE* reading so I always make sure to have a reading goal every year. It's hard to set a list of books to read because I have different reading moods. It's like meal planning for the week but you really just want to have pizza. I thought I should create more general reading goals so I can make time to read. 

- Balance reading and listening/audiobooks
- Stop buying new books until I read more of what I've aleady purchased
- Utilize [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com) to more efficiently take in business/professional knowledge

[Goal: 0/24 books]() 

_reading stats_
- 0 fiction / 0 non-fiction
- 0 read /  0 listen
- 0 re-reads
- 0 blinks

## 2020 Goals :trophy:
These are the goals I'd like to focus on this year. 

- [ ] Take care of my body and mind (habit)
  - What do I want to achieve?
    - Habitually exercise 30 minutes daily
    - Walk when possible instead of driving
    - Sleep 56 hours per week with a consistent bedtime
  - What are the benefits of achieving this goal?
    - My body is the only one I have, and I can't help others if I am burnt out or drained. By taking care of myself, I increase my own capability to achieve and assist.
  - Milestones (per quarter):
    - [ ] Dance for 2,000 minutes (154 minutes/week)

    - Establish a habit of eating < 50g of carbs daily
    - Gradually introduce meal prepping to eat more quality food
    - Return to the physical shape I was in mid-late 2018
  - What are the benefits of achieving this goal?
    - This is a targeted sub-goal within taking care of my body and mind.
  - Milestones:
    - [ ] Track nutrition for 1 week to establish baseline
    - [ ] Complete 1 month of modified keto
    - [ ] Down to size 8

  - What do I want to achieve?
    - Free up at least $300 per month additional
    - Pay off student loans and other remaining debt
    - Begin saving for a down payment on a house
  - What are the benefits of achieving this goal?
    - Owning a home in the areas I am looking at is significantly less expensive each month than my current renting. This would free up money that could otherwise go toward:
      - Getting help around the house (cleaning, childcare)
      - Increasing investments
      - Upgrading from my Corolla to a comfortable EV
  - Milestones:
    - [ ] Review _You Need a Budget_ to determine current non-essential monthly spending
    - [ ] "Guilt free" budget amount allocated to Acorns Spend card

    - Send cards, gifts, etc., when special events come up
    - Be more present in conversations
    - Stop volunteering for things I can't commit to
    - Have time for the community building important to me
  - What are the benefits of achieving this goal?
    - I pride myself on being responsible and true to my word. When I overcommit myself, I tend to be unable to follow through on the things I say I'll do, and community involvement and relationships tend to be the first things to suffer from this. By being more intentional, I can stop sliding toward flakiness and be there for the people I care about.
  - Milestones:

    - [ ] Community involvement list for 2020 reviewed, pruned and locked

    - Be more comfortable talking with people and groups at a wide variety of formality levels
  - What are the benefits of achieving this goal?
    - By strengthening my competencies in areas which will directly impact my areas of responsibility, I will increase my confidence in my abilities, continue to deliver more value at work, and continue to grow the company I work for. Additionally, strengthening this directly benefits my financial goals as additional value created opens opportunities for additional income to apply toward debt, investments and savings.
