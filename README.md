# Personal Goals (Updated: Jan 4, 2020)

Personal goals made open source. For 2020, I want to begin logging in GitHub so I can better document and access my plans. I currently use the [Full Focus Planner | Bold](https://fullfocusstore.com/products/full-focus-planner-bold-by-megan-hyatt-miller-annual-subscription) for my written planner needs. I'm always iterating my goal setting.

## Personal Foursquare 
I wanted to create a foursquare to give more focus to any goals I set.

| Myself   | Relationships | Career  | World |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
|   |   |   |  |
|   |   |   |   |


## Reading Goal :books:
I *LOVE* reading so I always make sure to have a reading goal every year. It's hard to set a list of books to read because I have different reading moods. It's like meal planning for the week but you really just want to have pizza. I thought I should create more general reading goals so I can make time to read.

## 2020 Goals :trophy:
These are the goals I'd like to focus on this year.

## 4 Annual Quarters
The idea behind 12 Week Year is setting goals per 12 weeks versus the full year. Instead of separating my planning monthly or by quarter as previous years, I'm listing them out as 12 weeks.
