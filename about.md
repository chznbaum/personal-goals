Personal goals made open source. Inspired by [Una Kravets](https://una.im/personal-goals-guide/) and [Candi Lemoine](https://github.com/candicodeit/personal-goals).

I've always been ambitious, but struggled with actually planning things. I have picked up planners and to-do software with the best intentions, only to cast them aside unused. Over time, I have worked to build better habits to overcome executive function challenges I've faced, but planning has until very recently remained an elusive thing.

My current role has pushed me to implement a proper planning and tracking system in order to remain successful. Having stepped out of the individual contributor space, it has also been vital to maintain awareness of the value I bring at work and opportunities to improve.

During 2019, I started using the [Full Focus Planner](https://fullfocusplanner.com). This quarterly planner gives the structure I need to prioritize and accomplish my daily and weekly responsibilities, and provides space for improving my daily rituals and self-care. By breaking up the planner into quarters, I also had incentive to pick the practice back up if I got off track. I currently use the [bold line](https://fullfocusstore.com/products/full-focus-planner-bold-by-megan-hyatt-miller-annual-subscription), which maintain the professional structure and usability while being beautiful with feminine touches.

While this has been a massive improvement in my day-to-day workflows, 2019 has shown me how easy it is for quarters and years to escape me: for my goals and achievements to occur on autopilot instead of being intentionally directed.

For 2020, I'm going to use what I learn from my Full Focus Planner, incorporate some of the methodology from [Candi Lemoine](https://github.com/candicodeit/personal-goals), build in goal logging via GitHub, and begin an annual reflection and planning regimen. Here's to a productive quarter!
